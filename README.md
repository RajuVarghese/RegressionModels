# Coursera Data Science 7: Regression Models Project

## Overview

This repository contains files for the project of the [Coursera Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1) course [Regression Models](https://class.coursera.org/regmods-014). The project spec is as follow:

> You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

* “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
* "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

## Files

My project submission is in the file report.pdf the source of which is report.Rmd. As the report is expected to be just 2 pages long with an appendix of max 3 pages just for the plots I have removed the R code and/or results from the main part to comply with the length requirement. It is pretty difficult to explain it within two pages and hence I have also made a longer file with some additional content to make a report as I would have written it had there been no limitation on the length. This is in the file detailed-report.pdf (source is detailed-report.Rmd)
